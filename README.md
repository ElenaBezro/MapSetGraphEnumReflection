Morning session

1.Days of the Week:
Create an enum named DayOfWeek to represent the days of the week.
Define constants for each day (e.g., SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, etc.) within the enum.
Implement a method called getNextDay in the enum that calculates and returns the next day of the week for a given day.
Demonstrate the usage of the DayOfWeek enum by using it to find the next day for a specific day (e.g., next day after "TUESDAY").

2.Card Suits:
Create an enum named CardSuit to represent the four suits in a standard deck of cards (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades).
Define constants for each suit within the enum.
Implement a method called getRandomSuit in the enum that selects and returns a random card suit.
Demonstrate the usage of the CardSuit enum by generating and printing a random card suit.

3.Months of the Year:
Create an enum named Month to represent the months of the year.
Define constants for each month (e.g., JANUARY, FEBRUARY, etc.) within the enum.
Implement a constructor in the enum that takes an integer representing the number of days in the month and stores it as an instance variable.
Implement a method called getDays that returns the number of days in a specific month.
Demonstrate the usage of the Month enum by finding and printing the number of days in a particular month (e.g., "FEBRUARY").

4.Directional Constants:
Create an enum named Direction to represent cardinal directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST).
Define constants for each direction within the enum.
Implement a constructor in the enum that takes two integers, deltaX and deltaY, representing changes in x and y coordinates when moving in that direction.
Implement methods in the enum to calculate new x and y coordinates based on the current position and direction.
Demonstrate the usage of the Direction enum by simulating movement in different directions from a given starting position.

5.Traffic Lights:
Create an enum named TrafficLight to represent the three colors of a traffic light (RED, YELLOW, GREEN).
Define constants for each color within the enum.
Implement a method called getNextColor that calculates and returns the next color in the traffic light sequence.
Demonstrate the usage of the TrafficLight enum by simulating a traffic light sequence, starting from a given color, and printing the sequence.
