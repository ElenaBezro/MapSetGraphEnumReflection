Morning session

1. Basic HashMap:
   Create a HashMap named studentMap to store student information as key-value pairs.
   Define the key as the student ID (integer) and the value as the student's name (string).
   Add at least three students with their IDs and names to the map.
   Retrieve and print the name of a specific student by providing their ID using the get method.
   Confirm that the retrieval works as expected.

2.Iterating Over HashMap:
Iterate through the studentMap using a for-each loop or an iterator.
For each entry, print both the student ID (key) and the student name (value).
Emphasize that the order of the entries in a HashMap is not guaranteed to be in any specific order.

3.LinkedHashMap with Insertion Order:
Create a LinkedHashMap named capitalMap to store country-capital pairs.
Add entries for at least three countries and their respective capitals to the map.
Ensure that you add the entries in a specific order.
Demonstrate that the LinkedHashMap maintains insertion order by iterating through it and printing the country-capital pairs.

4.Removing Entries from HashMap:
Remove an entry from the studentMap by specifying the student's ID as the key to be removed.
Use the remove method to remove the entry.
Verify that the entry has been successfully removed by attempting to retrieve the student's name by their ID and checking if it returns null.

5.Using HashMap for Counting:
Create a HashMap named wordCountMap to count the frequency of words in a given text.
Split a sample text into words by using a space as the delimiter and store the words in an array.
Iterate through the array of words and update the counts in wordCountMap. Use the put method to add new words to the map or update the count if the word already exists.
Print the word frequencies stored in the map to verify that each word's count has been correctly calculated.
